# Ruby Capstone

### Hello there! The mais objetive of this project is to create a web scraper, that retrieves information from someone's Github repositories, by using their username.

### The main feature of this application is the capacity to filter and sort the result.

#### Filter options:
- Programming language
- Last updated
- Programming language and last updated

#### Sort options:
- Programming language
- Last updated
- Number of stars
- These can be ascending (a-z/ 1-10) or descending (z-a/ 10-1)

To accomplish this it was used Ruby as programming language, the Rspec framework for testing and debugging just as Rubocop to lint. I also would like to point out the gems used, which were Date, Nokogiri, Faraday and Rubocop.
